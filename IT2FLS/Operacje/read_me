The software in this folder focuses on the type-reduction for interval type-2 FLSs.

Each M-file is keyed into a section of Chapter 9 of the book Uncertain Rule-Based 
Fuzzy Logic Systems: Introduction and New Directions, by Jerry M. Mendel, 
and published by Prentice-Hall, 2000. 

These M-files were prepared after the book was published and so are not mentioned 
in that book. They were created in order to simplify the programming of 
type-reduction methods by the designer.


Description of M-files

Here we provide brief descriptions of the M-files that appear in this folder. 
For more help on any specific file, type 
help (filename) at MATLAB prompt.

centroid_tr.m: Function used to implement the centroid type-reduction method 
that is described in Section 9.5.1 of the book.

csum_tr.m: Function used to implement the center-of-sums  type-reduction method 
that is described in Section 9.5.2 of the book.

height_tr.m: Function used to implement the height  type-reduction method that 
is described in Section 9.5.3 of the book.

md_height_tr.m: Function used to implement the modified height  type-reduction 
method that is described in Section 9.5.4 of the book.

cos_tr.m: Function used to implement the center-of-sets  type-reduction method 
that is described in Section 9.5.5 of the book.
